# Data-Structure-challenges
The challenges are as follows:
1.	Stacks:
•	Challenge 1: Reverse a List 
Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.
•	Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses 
Check for balanced parentheses. Given a string, check if there are ( and ) characters, and return true if the parentheses in the string are balanced. 
2.	Linked List:
•	Challenge 1: Print in Reverse 
 Create a function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order. 
•	Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node 
Create a function that finds the middle node of a linked list. 
•	Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List  
Create a function that reverses a linked list. You do this by manipulating the nodes so that they’re linked in the other direction. 
•	Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences 
 Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked list. The implementation is similar to the removeAfter method that you implemented
